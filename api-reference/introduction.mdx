## Base URL

Use your deployment base URL, for example:

`https://cora-api-bz2d.onrender.com`

All endpoints in this section live under:

`/api/v2/accounts`

## Authentication

Requests require:

- `X-API-Key`: your public API key
- `X-Organization-Id`: organization scope for the request

If a key is configured for exactly one organization, `X-Organization-Id` may be omitted.

The OpenAPI spec for these routes is in:

`/api-reference/openapi.json`

```json
"security": [
  {
    "ApiKeyAuth": []
  }
]
```
